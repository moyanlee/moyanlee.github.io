        <h2 class="right">Who created it?</h2>

        <p class="paragraph right">Nasty Nets was a by-proudct of the website Del.icio.us, a social link-sharing platform</p>
        <p class="paragraph right">Founded in 2006, Nasty nets followed the tragetory of Del.icio.us developing into a collobartive blogging website
            that focused on collecting and archiving decontexualized online media. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="right">What is it? </h2>
        
        <p class="right">Nasty Nets was a collaborative blogging site where users would post content from all corners 
            of the web. The platform serves as a precursor to some of the more centralized platforms we see today
            (Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr). Similar to these platforms, users could interact through commenting and 
            making follow-up posts. Posts varied from web-screenshots and advertisements to alternations and collages 
            of found-media. The lo-fi aesthetic coupled with material created by amature users of the site
            made Nasty Nets a site for artistic expression thorough digital means.
