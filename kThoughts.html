        <p class="right">Browsing through Nasty Net's once maintained website feels like excavating through historical ruins. 
            There, I find images of the most random things: a gif of wine being poured, a face made through a collage 
            of other people's facial features, and a link to music I've never heard before. 
        </p>

            Nasty Net's minimalist aesthetic and collaborative artwork reminds me of Adult Swim, a nightime television
            programming block of the cable network Cartoon Network. Adult Swim shows are known for their ammature-eqsue 
            animation style, as seen through shows like Home Movies and Space Ghost Coast to Coast.

        <p class="right">
            Both Nasty Nets and Adult swim both thrive off the unpolished feel of their media and use it as a way of 
            fostering artists collobration between everyday folks. An example of this can be seen through Flying Lotus, 
            a producer and dj whose fame was fostered through Adult Swim. One day while watching Adult Swim, Lotus saw
            that Adult Swim was accepting beat sumbissions from their audience. After submitting his beat, Adult Swim approved it 
            and later used it for a promotional video for The Boondocks.

        </div>

        <p class="right">
            Both Nasty Nets and Adult Swim embrace the the digital world as a space for collaboration, not matter how polished it is. 
            That is beauty of these spaces, everyday people have the opportunity to create something creative and original through random 
            collaboration.
